Description
===========

The SCGI module is heavily based on the FastCGI when it comes
to configuration. Only the internal protocol between server
and client has been replaced. Please check the documentation
of the FastCGI module for more information.

History
=======

Added in lighttpd 1.3.14 as it was really simple to do.
