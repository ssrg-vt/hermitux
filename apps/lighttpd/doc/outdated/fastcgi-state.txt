Description
===========

States
------

The state-engine is currently made of 6 states which are walk-through on
the way each connection.

:init:
  prepare fastcgi-connection
:connect:
  waiting for a connection
:prepwrite:
  build the fastcgi-request
:write:
  write the fastcgi-request to the network
:read:
  read fastcgi-response from network and push it to the write-queue
:close:
  terminate the connection

Delays
------

connect, write and read may need to wait for an fdevent. That's the reason
for the loop in the state-diagram.
