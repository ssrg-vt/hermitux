  How to set up SSL in lighttpd

Description
===========

lighttpd supports SSLv2 and SSLv3 if it is compiled against openssl.

Configuration
-------------

To enable SSL for the whole server you have to provide a valid
certificate and have to enable the SSL engine.::

  ssl.engine = "enable"
  ssl.pemfile = "/path/to/server.pem"

The HTTPS protocol does not allow you to use name-based virtual
hosting with SSL. If you want to run multiple SSL servers with
one lighttpd instance you must use IP-based virtual hosting: ::

  $SERVER["socket"] == "10.0.0.1:443" {
    ssl.engine                  = "enable"
    ssl.pemfile                 = "www.example.org.pem"
    server.name                 = "www.example.org"

    server.document-root        = "/www/servers/www.example.org/pages/"
  }

If you have a .crt and a .key file, cat them together into a
single PEM file:
::

  $ cat host.key host.crt > host.pem


Self-Signed Certificates
------------------------

A self-signed SSL certificate can be generated like this: ::

  $ openssl req -new -x509 \
    -keyout server.pem -out server.pem \
    -days 365 -nodes
