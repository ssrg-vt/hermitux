  limiting bandwidth usage

Description
===========

Starting with 1.3.8, lighttpd supports limiting the bandwidth for
a single connection or config context like a virtual host or a URL.

Options
=======

:connection.kbytes-per-second:
  limit the throughput for each single connection to the given
  limit in kbyte/s

  default: 0 (no limit)

:server.kbytes-per-second:
  limit the throughput for all connections to the given limit
  in kbyte/s

  if you want to specify a limit for a special virtual server
  use: ::

    $HTTP["host"] == "www.example.org" {
      server.kbytes-per-second = 128
    }

  which will override the default for this host.

  default: 0 (no limit)

Additional Notes
================

Keep in mind that a limit below 32kb/s might actually limit the traffic to 32kb/s. This
is caused by the size of the TCP send buffer.
