Description
===========

The access module is used to deny access to files with given trailing path names.

Options
=======

url.access-deny
  Denies access to all files with any of given trailing path names.

  Default: empty

  Example: ::

    url.access-deny = ( "~", ".inc")

  will deny access to all files ended with a diacritical mark (~) or .inc
  such as example~ or example.inc.  A trailing diacritical mark is often
  used by editors for backup files.  And the .inc extension is often used
  for include files with code.
